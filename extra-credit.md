# Extra Credit

EC needs to only be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF.

## General Requirements

Some assignments will have specific requirements.  However, for most events, use
the following guidelines:

Throughout this semester, you will have the opportunity to attend various
seminars or events, and write a brief reflection on them for extra credit.
These reflections should be written as a formal two-page paper.  You may
consider the following questions when writing your reflection, but there are no
specific formatting requirements:

* What did you learn?
* Were there any algorithms involved? (Even if not explicitly discussed).
* What is a piece of advise that you took away?
* Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?
* Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?
* If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?
* Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what
  was it?
* Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee
  / collaborator in the future?
* What is your take-away message from this event?

## EC-1

I am invited to give a seminar on ``Fostering Collaboration among Research
Groups.''  On Monday, 24 August 2020, I will give a practice talk at 14:30. The
audience for this talk is PhD students and postdocs who are in the AISES
[Lighting the Pathway program](https://www.aises.org/content/lighting-pathway).
So, as an audience member, please put on your improt had and pretend to be a PhD
student interested in learning more about how to work in collaborations.  I
invite questions during the talk (where you would try to ask questions that you
could imagine that the participants would ask).  After the talk, I will request
feedback from the audience. Any/all feedback is welcome.  By 12:00 on Tuesday,
you must submit a one-page summary of your feedback.  What would work well is
two bullet-point lists: one of what went well and one of what could be improved.
(Note: usually, I would give one week for the write-up, but the actual seminar
will be on Wednesday, 26 August, and I would look forward to improving my
presentation based on your feedback).  Zoom link will be posted in the course
discussion board over the weekend.  I expect this session will be 1.5 hours.
